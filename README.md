#Name
A simple fullstack bloglist web application

#Description
I built this bloglist web application as a means to practice my MERN stack Initially. This has helped me improved my fundamentals of MERN stack. However, I decided to expand upon the backend, and learnt to build a backend that could intereact with a relational databse, namely MySQL. Since the code between the frontend and backends are quite similar despite beign different in terms of database part of the stack, I decided to fit them all into 1 repository so that it would easier to anyone to clone and run them. I will furhter elaborate on the details of each file in their own READMEs. This way, the information will be refactored and therefore much easier to understand.

#Features
There are quite a few features, but the most prominent ones are:

-   Users can log in and out of their accounts - seamlessly.
-   Passwords are secured via encryption using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt.
-   Blog posts include essential details like name, author, and URL.
-   Only blog creators can delete their posts, enforced in both frontend and backend.
-   Users can 'like' blogs, with popular ones sorted to the top of the list.
-   Separate versions for MySQL and MongoDB databases.
